# Description

This file contains notes related to this project.

This program can be run via: `python main.py`. By default this will use the CHARMM absinth file as defined in the `config.yaml` file and will perform a check of the existing parameters. Since this can generate a lot of noise in the terminal, a "quiet" mode exists. To make it active, pass the `-q` flag to the main program. 

In case you want to use the unofficial OPLS ABSINTH file, run `python main.py -oa`.
